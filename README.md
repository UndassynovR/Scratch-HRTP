![start](./screenshots/1.png)
This project was created as an assignment for the [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/0/scratch/) course.

Scratch-HRTP is a game created in Scratch, inspired by the first Touhou game, ["Highly Responsive to Prayers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_Responsive_to_Prayers). In this game, you'll embark on a challenging journey through 5 stages filled with obstacles, and your goal is to break all the tiles with a yin-yang orb while staying alive.

## Gameplay

### Objective

Your objective is to break all the tiles on each of the 5 stages using the yin-yang orb. After completing these stages, prepare for an epic showdown with a challenging boss!
